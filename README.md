# Scripts

just scripts to automate farming, leveling, etc. on mobile games

everything is fully-automated even when the window is in background or minimized

I'm planning to use Android Debug Bridge (adb) along with AHK as well.

# Autohotkey
AutoHotkey is a free, open source macro-creation and automation software utility that allows users to automate repetitive tasks. It is driven by a custom scripting language that is aimed specifically at providing keyboard shortcuts, otherwise known as hotkeys.  AutoHotkey_L started as a fork of AutoHotkey but has been the main branch for some time.  https://autohotkey.com/
